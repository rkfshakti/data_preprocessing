# Project Documentation — Overview

This folder contains conceptual documentation for each analysis step in the demo pipeline. Each document explains what the analysis is, why it's useful, how it's implemented in this repo, and how to interpret outputs.

Start here and then open the specific pages for Preprocessing, EDA, Topic Modeling, Clustering, Predictive Terms, Co-occurrence, Sentiment Analysis, and the Report Template.

Files:
- `preprocessing.md` — cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization
- `eda.md` — top terms, n-grams, wordcloud, keyword trends, correlation heatmap
- `topic_modeling.md` — LDA, topic keywords extraction, topic–sentiment correlation
- `clustering.md` — KMeans clustering and cluster characterization
- `predictive_terms.md` — logistic predictive-term extraction and interpretation
- `cooccurrence.md` — co-occurrence matrix and heatmap explanation
- `sentiment_analysis.md` — VADER use, spikes detection and interpretation
- `report_template.md` — how the Jinja2 template assembles outputs into tabs
